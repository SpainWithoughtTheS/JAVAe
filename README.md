## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

#### 1. **JavaFX Issues (NoClassDefFoundError or JavaFX not found)**

**Error**: `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javafx/application/Application`

**Fix**: JavaFX may not be bundled with your JDK. Install **OpenJFX** and add it to your `pom.xml`. You can find more information [here](https://openjfx.io/).

Example addition in `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
    <artifactId>javafx-controls</artifactId>
    <version>17</version>
</dependency>
```

#### 2. **Maven Dependency Errors**

**Error**: `Could not find artifact...`

**Fix**: Run `mvn clean install` to ensure all dependencies are correctly downloaded. If the error persists, check your `pom.xml` for any incorrect or missing dependencies.

#### 3. **No Portfolio Displayed**

**Error**: `NullPointerException` or no portfolio generated

**Fix**: Ensure that all fields in the input form are filled correctly. Check the logs or console output for any specific error messages and ensure that the input data is valid.

#### 4. **Invalid Java Version**

**Error**: `Unsupported major.minor version`

**Fix**: Ensure that your Java version matches the version required by the project (Java 8 or later). You can download the appropriate version from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).
